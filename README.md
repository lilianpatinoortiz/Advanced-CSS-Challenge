# Space Rnner Portfolio

### ~ Advanced-CSS-Challenge ðŸ˜Ž

## Description

This project was a great start for showing my personal portfolio, which I can use on my resume in the future when being contacted by recruiters!
The advantage of having a portfolio is that I can show some personal applications and the process behind them... and Its available 24/7.
My plan is to eventually add this site to a personal domain and update it regulartly with the projects I develop outside my full-time job.
